Summoners War Rune Manager

Details:

This program allows the user to have a better visualization of thier runes in the mobile game called Summoners War. To run the the
application, once the files are downloaded, run the .exe file found in the SWRuneManager folder. This will prompt you to select a 
database (in .mdb format) and a .csv file with the rune information. There are two such example files located in the resources folder
that can be used the program. The rest of the application should be straightforward on how to use, with the UI being intuitive.

Languages Used:

-Visual Basic
-SQL
